Background\n3.1.3 Compound Losses\nCombo Loss\nThe Combo Loss (Taghanaki et al., 2019) is a compound objective that combines a region-based\noverlap term (Dice coefficient) with a pixel-wise classification term (weighted binary cross-\nentropy, wBCE). It is particularly useful in scenarios where both small object segmentation and\npixel-wise accuracy are important.\nFormally, the Combo LossLCombo is defined as\nLCombo =λL wBCE + (1−λ)L Dice,(3.10)\nwhereλ∈[0,1]controls the trade-off between the two components. The first term,L wBCE,\ncorresponds to the weighted binary cross-entropy loss mentioned earlier (Eq. 3.1.1), which is",
      "as the dominant paradigm in medical image analysis.\nDespite these advances, medical segmentation faces challenges related to data and task\nstructure. In many datasets, the region of interest (e.g., a lesion or vessel) constitutes only a\nsmall portion of the image, while the background dominates. This imbalance biases standard\nloss functions such as cross-entropy toward the majority class, resulting in poor detection of\nsmall or rare structures (Sudre et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2022). Because these underrepresented\nregions often carry the greatest clinical significance, addressing imbalance is essential for robust\nand fair segmentation.\nSeveral loss functions have been proposed to address this issue, including cross-entropy\nand Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017), Dice and Tversky (Milletari et al., 2016; Salehi et al., 2017)\nand extensions or combinations such as Focal Tversky, Combo Loss and the Unified Focal Loss\n(Abraham and Khan, 2019; Taghanaki et al., 2019; Yeung et al., 2022).",
